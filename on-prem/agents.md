# On-prem Agent
The Workato on-prem agent provides a secure way for Workato to selectively access customer-authorized on-prem apps, databases, and folders without having to open ports in the corporate firewall.

Once the on-prem feature is enabled for your account, view the on-prem option in the **Tools** menu.

## Overview
The following is a conceptual model of Workato's on-prem agent and how it interacts with databases and applications behind the firewall.

*Conceptual model for on-prem agent and connector*

Workato on-prem connectivity has 2 core components:

- Tunneling
- Database and filesystem access.

The on-prem agent runs within the customerâ€™s data center, behind the firewall, and establishes a TLS websocket tunnel to connect out to Workato.

The on-prem agent can be configured to access the selected databases and filesystems behind the firewall. Since 2.2.x it also supports connections to [JMS-compliant systems](/connectors/jms.md).

## Supported operating systems
The on-prem agent runs on the following systems:

- Linux (64-bit)

- Windows 7, 10 (64-bit)

- Mac OS X

Minimum hardware requirements for the system running the on-prem agent are:

- 8GB of RAM
- 250 MB of disk space
- 800 Mhz 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD).

- Credentials provided in the app connection are correct
- Credentials provided by user in the app connection has the correct role and permission to connect

If connecting to on-prem databases fail, check that:
- Selected agent is active
- Credentials provided in the connection profile are correct
