# Access Tokens

Access tokens are string fields that identify the client of a Callable Recipe. The token value is a secret that is shared between a client and the Workato server. A token is passed to the API in an authorization header. The header must have a valid value in order for the call to succeed.

Workato supports two token formats: Auth Key and JSON Web Token (JWT).

## Auth Tokens

An Auth Token is automatically generated when an Access Profile is created. It is a long string.

The Access Profile screen displays this string (but masked for security reasons) after a Profile is created:

The auth token can be copied to the clipboard. The "Refresh" button will generate a new Auth Token value and invlidate any previous value.

When calling an endpoint, the Auth Token value is passed as the value of the "API-Key" header.

## JWT Tokens

For additional security, clients can now make use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). These are a standard ([RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for web authentication. JWT tokens are signed using a secret or key selected by the client.

When JWT is selected in the Access Profile screen, there are two additional field values to select. One is the signing method and the other is a secret or key field.

Workato supports two signing methods: HMAC and RSA. HMAC uses a symmetric shared secret (client and server have the same secret). RSA uses an asymmetric key pair (client has a private key and shared the public key with the server). HMAC uses a 256-bit secret value.

If you select HMAC, you will see the following fields in the Access Profile screen:

The shared secret can be any value that you select, but for best security, it should be a long value generated by a secure random number generator. If you have openssl, you can generate such a value with the commmand:

```
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Paste the secret value into the "JWT HMAC secret" field.

If you select "RSA" then you must have a RSA public key/certificate and a corresponding RSA private key. One way to generate this is by using openssh:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

This will generate two files, one for the private key (no extension) and one for the public key (.pub extension). A typical public key file might look like this:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC4O6vRGXTkXWQ4yjj6baC7xAlrJPagWQ1WgI7RBUfk5PRPyD88Lp1vqe0CqshOIEeIVca3mD+W0YtJGlu4IaFh2gIC0W2lQY+3yXkzw2IQvnK1jjzxLJ6Dho7Vh3kLVqlmDB0ABdFhoU+vZf19AnLMqGhmu81xXoutK89MJAfvGFWbZ/zfM/yl9aqTOVrEJFpUxloL2IY/EAiUqblRTH5KWtimetEPF8VG3hu/YeU/5/CzPGZaLKUOcO3k0A6a6iIA2ruV180QN0FmgrCUsQ6oA6vWZsY1LuJm3bnLv7KJApR+WYqp7OCMlhk67N7zxkbZqNb2+eyUCx7E2SFCjFkR jdart@bear
```

The public key needs to be pasted into the "Public Key" field in the Access Profile screen.

## Generating JWT Tokens

A JWT token can encapsulate several pieces of information that the client communicates to the server. For Workato, the essential information is the Workato access key and the name of the user. These should be placed in a JSON structure similar to the following:

```
{
  "sub": "d4aee74e131926682043395edecaf377765fae48e56e232cb295af475b314545",
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

Here "sub" is the Auth Key that is obtainable from the Access Profile screen in Workato, and "name" is the name of the client.

The JWT token is a signed representation of the JSON structure. You can generate a JWT token using the tools at [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/).

With JWT, the client is responsible for generating and packaging a token in the correct format. An online tool is available at [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/) to facilitate this. The JSON format text mentioned above should be pasted or typed into the "payload" field on the "Decoded" side of the tool. In addition, paste in your private key (RSA) or secret string (HMAC) in the "Verify Signature" section. The signed and encoded key then appears on the right-hand side in the "Encoded" section.

The two standard algorithms Workato supports are "HS256" (aka HMAC) and "RS256" (aka RSA).

For example, generation of an HMAC JWT might look like this:

The encoded and signed token is passed to the Workato API in the "Authorization" header (see [Calling APIS](/api-mgmt/calling-apis.md)).
