# Product notifications

To communicate product-level information to our users, we make them available on three main sites:

- [Status page](https://status.workato.com/#)
- [Product updates page](/product-updates.md)
- [Product blog](https://product.workato.com/)

We recommend that users subscribe to these pages to receive timely updates on the changes and enhancements that happen with our product. Read on for details on the information available on these pages.

## Website and server status

The following are classified as website/server updates:

- Website uptime & downtime
- Status of recipe job processing
- Status of on-premise connectivity
- Status of webhook ingestion
- Past incidents that affect recipe performance

All information related to these issues are posted on **[status.workato.com](https://status.workato.com/#)**.

## Error notifications

Workato will send out emails to specified users when errors occur in your recipes. Read the documentation on [error notification emails](/recipes/error-notifications.md) for more information on the types of errors and their different emails, the notification policy and configuring contact emails.

## Major changes

The following are classified as major changes:

- Potential recipe-breaking change
- Changes to security/legal terms
- Actions/applications that will be removed/deprecated and no longer grandfathered
- Changes that require you, the user to make edits to their recipes to make sure they continue running
- Planned downtime (maintenance etc.)

These changes may affect recipe performance and are thus categorised as major changes. At Workato, we try to keep these changes to a minimum to ensure that your recipes do not need to be edited unless absolutely necessary.

Information about these changes will be sent to your Workato email at least **30 days** in advance. Reminder emails will then be sent to you **14 days** and **7 days** prior to the change. One final email will be sent to you once the change is live on our site. The emails will be sent to the addresses provided in the [error notifications settings tab](https://www.workato.com/users/current/edit#notifications).

Please keep a lookout for these emails and follow the instructions as stated.

## Product enhancements & fixes

The following are classified as product enhancements/fixes:

- Connector enhancements
- Bug fixes
- New platform features
- New connectors
- UI changes

If any of these changes were brought to our attention by you through any of our support channels, rest assured that the customer success team will reach out to you directly to inform you of the changes.

These changes are completely backward compatible will not require you to take any action. All this information can be found on the **[Product updates page](/product-updates.md)**. Product-level highlights and monthly updates will also be written in more detail on the **[Product blog](https://product.workato.com/)**.
