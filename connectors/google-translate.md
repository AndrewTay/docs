# Google Translate
[Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) allows quickly translating an arbitrary text into any supported language using state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation. Language detection is also available in case the source language is unknown. The underlying technology is updated constantly to include improvements from Google research teams, which results in better translations and new languages and language pairs.

Workato's Google Translate connector allows you to build powerful automation and connect with other applications in the workflow.

## API version
The Google Translate connector uses [Google Translation API v2](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest).

## How to connect to Google Translate on Workato
