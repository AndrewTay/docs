* **Connection name**

  Give the JumpCloud connection a unique name that identifies which JumpCloud instance it is connected to.

* **API key**

  Create an API key in JumpCloud which grants Workato access to your JumpCloud. This can be done over by following the instructions over [here](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization-overview). Do note, you will need to be a JumpCloud administrator to generate an API key.

* **Organisation ID**

  This field is only required if there are multiple organisations under the same administrator whose API key is used. Head over [here](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/1.0/authentication-and-authorization/multi-tenant-organization-api-headers#to-obtain-an-individual-organization-id-via-the-ui) to find out what your organisation ID is.
