# Amazon S3 trigger - New/updated CSV file
Triggers when a CSV file is added or updated in a selected bucket/folder in Amazon S3.

Checks selected folder for new or updated CSV file every 5 minutes. The output includes the fileâ€™s metadata and file contents, which are CSV rows delivered in batches.

Note that in Amazon S3, when a file is renamed, it is considered a new file. When a file is uploaded and overwrites an existing file with the same name, it is considered an updated file but not a new file.
