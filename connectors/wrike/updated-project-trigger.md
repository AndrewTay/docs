# Wrike - New/updated project triggers

Projects are one of the main ways to organize, manage, and report on work within Wrike. In essence, Wrike projects are folders with additional properties.

## New/updated project trigger

This trigger picks up projects that are created or updated and returns the project tree data. Each record is processed as a separate job.
