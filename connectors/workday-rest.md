# Workday REST
[Workday](https://www.workday.com/) is a cloud financial management and human capital management software that seamlessly combines finance and HR for greater business performance and visibility into organizational data.

Use the Workday REST integration connector to sync data between your Workday REST instance and other cloud applications.

The Workday REST connector works best when you are executing small transactions (e.g. approve inbox task). If your use case requires you to work with larger datasets (e.g. full reports from Workday) or with custom reports/objects, use the [Workday integration connector](/connectors/workday.md) instead.

The Workday REST connector documentation contains the following chapters:
- [Connection setup](workday-rest/connection-setup.md)
- [New worker trigger](workday-rest/new-worker-trigger.md)
- [Create a job change action](workday-rest/create-job-change-action.md)
- [Get inbox task(s) action](workday-rest/get-inbox-tasks-action.md)
- [Approve/reject inbox task action](workday-rest/approve-reject-inbox-task-action.md)
- [Get worker by ID action](workday-rest/get-worker-action.md)
- [Search workers action](workday-rest/search-worker-action.md)
