# Google Sheets
[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is a powerful cloud application that enables real-time team collaboration on spreadsheets, available from any device, even when offline.

Workato enables you to write data to a Google spreadsheet automatically as part of a workflow, e.g. leads filling out a form will be moved to a spreadsheet. You can also read rows of data from Google spreadsheets and move it to another app, e.g. moving respondents who had filled out a Google Form from Google Sheets into a marketing campaign app, or into a CRM.
