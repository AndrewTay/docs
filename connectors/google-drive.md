# Google Drive
[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) is a popular file storage and collaboration environment, that is used by both consumers and businesses alike.

The Google Drive connector enables you to build powerful automations around Google Drive and connect with other applications.

## API version
Workato's Google Drive connector currently uses Google Drive [API v3](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk).

## How to connect to Google Drive on Workato
The Google Drive connector uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. When prompted, follow the on-screen [connection instructions](https://docs.workato.com/connections.html) and login to your Google account to connect. Your Google account needs to have `Edit` permission to all files and folders that you will use in Workato recipe.
