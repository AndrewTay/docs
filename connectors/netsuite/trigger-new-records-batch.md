# NetSuite trigger - New/updated records (batch)

Triggers every 5 minutes. Depend on the name of the trigger you selected, trigger will retrieve a list of NetSuite records' created or updated since the last time recipe triggered. Maximum batch size is 200 records.

## Input fields
Select the NetSuite object to monitor. In this example, we select `Customer`.

Optionally, you can configure these 2 optional fields:

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | Trigger will retrieve NetSuite records created/updated from this date/time. |
| Batch size | Trigger may detect many new NetSuite records and process the records in several smaller batches. This field determines how many NetSuite records to retrieve in a batch. |

After that, you can proceed to configure the section `Output field configuration`. This section allows you to shortlist which NetSuite fields you want to use. Only those shortlisted fields will be displayed in trigger's output. This makes it easier to work with complex NetSuite objects with hundreds of fields.

In this example, we just want to use the fields `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, `phone` from the `Customer` record:
