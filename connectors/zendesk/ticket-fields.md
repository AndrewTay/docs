# Zendesk - Ticket fields
Zendesk tickets contain various ticket fields that add information about the ticket. Some fields are required inputs by the requester (e.g. Subject), while some fields are outputs generated by the system (e.g. Ticket ID).

## Ticket input fields

### Ticket default input fields
Zendesk's out-of-the-box ticket fields gather basic information. At default, only "subject" and "comment" is configured as mandatory.

| Input field  | Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Ticket form  | Select a ticket form to open preconfigured custom fields. |
| Subject      | The subject of the ticket.                                |
| Description  | The description of the ticket.                            |
| Type         | The type of ticket. Permitted values are `problem`, `incident`, `question`, or `task`. |
| Priority     | The priority of the ticket. Permitted values are `urgent`, `high`, `normal`, or `low`. |
| External ID  | A unique identifier from another system.                  |
| Status       | The status of the ticket. Permitted values are `open`, `pending`, `hold`, `solved`, or `closed`. |
| Requester ID | The unique Zendesk ID of the user who requested this ticket. |
| Submitter ID | The unique Zendesk ID of the user who submitted the ticket. An `Agent` can submit a ticket on behalf of a customer (requester). |
| Assignee ID  | The unique Zendesk ID of the `Agent` assigned to the ticket. |
| Organization ID | The unique Zendesk ID of the requester's organization.     |
| Group ID     | The unique Zendesk ID of the group assigned to the ticket. |
| Forum topic ID | The topic this ticket originated from.                    |
| Recipient email address | The email of the original recipient of the ticket. |
| Has incidents | Is `True` if this ticket has been marked as a `problem`, otherwise it will display `False.
| Due at       | Only applied if the ticket is a `task` type. The due date of the ticket. |
| Tags         | The tags applied to this ticket. You can add multiple tags with the `,` separator. |

### Ticket custom input field
Aside from the preconfigured fields, Zendesk allows you to customize ticket fields to suit your business use-cases. Below is an example of ticket custom fields.

| Ticket custom field   | Field type              | Mandatory |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|:---------:|
| Department            | **Dropdown**(`list`)    | Yes       |
| Linked to product ID  | **Numeric**(`int`)      | Yes       |
| Product short name    | **Text**(`string`)      | No        |
| Occurred before       | **Checkbox**(`boolean`) | Yes       |
| Date of last incident | **Date**(`date`)        | No        |

## Ticket output fields
Some ticket fields are manual inputs (e.g. Subject), while others are generated by the system (e.g. Ticket ID).

### Ticket default output fields
Depending on the field configuration, some fields might have `null` or default values.
