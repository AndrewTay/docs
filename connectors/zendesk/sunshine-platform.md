# Zendesk - Sunshine platform

Zendesk allows you to create custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (e.g. Tickets, Users, Organization). Custom objects can be configured to suit your various use-cases. It could be "product", "orders", "devices" etc.

For more information on Zendesk custom objects, please visit their documentation on this topic [here](https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002124307-What-is-the-Sunshine-platform-).
