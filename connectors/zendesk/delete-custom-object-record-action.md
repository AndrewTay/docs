# Zendesk - Delete custom object record action
Zendesk allows you to configure custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (e.g. Tickets, Users, Organization).  Find out more [here](/connectors/zendesk/custom-objects.md).

This action selects a specific custom object record by its Zendesk  ID and deletes the record from your Zendesk instance. For this action to run successfully, the recipe has to find an existing custom object record in your Zendesk instance.
