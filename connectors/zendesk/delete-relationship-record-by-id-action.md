# Zendesk - Delete relationship record by ID action
Zendesk allows you to configure custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (e.g. Tickets, Users, Organization). You can also configure custom relationships to define how objects are associated. Find out more [here](/connectors/zendesk/custom-objects.md).

This action selects a specific relationship record by its Zendesk ticket ID and deletes the record from your Zendesk instance. The specified record must exist in your Zendesk instance for this action to execute successfully.
