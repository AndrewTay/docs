# Zendesk - Custom objects

Zendesk allows you to create custom objects to model, store, and retrieve objects that are not native to Zendesk (e.g. Tickets, Users, Organization). Custom objects can be configured to suit your various use-cases. It could be "product", "orders", "devices" etc.

Workato allows you to interact with custom objects in the same way with native Zendesk objects. You create, read, update, and delete with the same ease like with Zendesk tickets, users, and organizations. 

To access custom objects control, login to your Zendesk instance and find **Sunshine Platform**.

After configuring your custom object type, you can proceed to create records#, get records#, update records# , and delete records# on the Workato platform.

### Custom relationships

You can also configure custom relationships between two custom objects or between a custom object and Zendesk object (e.g. Zendesk:user). This gives you more control over how object interact by associating the limits (minimum and maximum) of how one object can be associated with another.

You can view your custom relationship types in the **Relationship types** tab.
