# Zendesk - Organization fields
Zendesk organization contains various fields that add information about the organization. Some fields are required inputs by the creator (e.g. Name), while some fields are outputs generated by the system (e.g. Organization ID).

## Organization input fields
To register a new organization into your Zendesk instance, you are required to fill up certain information. This includes identifying information like "name" and permission controls.

### Organization default input fields
Zendesk's out-of-the-box organization fields gather basic information. At default, only "name" is configured as mandatory.

| Input field     | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Name            | The name of the organization.                      |
| External ID     | A unique identifier from another system.           |
| Domain name     | The domain name associated with this organization. |
| Details         | Details about the organization.                    |
| Notes           | Notes about the organization.                      |
| Group ID        | The unique Zendesk ID of the group of this organization. |
| Shared tickets  | Select `Yes` if the end-users in this organization are able to see each other's tickets, otherwise select `No`. |
| Shared comments | Select `Yes` if the end-users in this organization are able to see each other's comments on tickets, otherwise select `No`. |
| Tags            | The tags applied to this organization. You can add multiple tags with the `,` separator. |

### Organization custom input fields
Aside from the preconfigured fields, Zendesk allows you to customize organization fields to suit your business use-cases.

To view this list of organization custom fields, go to **settings** > under **Manage** > **Organization Fields**.
