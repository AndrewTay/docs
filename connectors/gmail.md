# Gmail
[Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail) is a popular e-mail service used by both consumers and businesses alike.

The Gmail connector enables you to build powerful automation around Gmail and connect with other applications.

## API version
This connector uses Gmail [API v1](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/).

## How to connect to Gmail on Workato
The Gmail connector uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. When prompted, follow the on-screen [connection instructions](https://docs.workato.com/connections.html) and login to your Google account to connect.

Based on Google's updated security policies, Gmail triggers or download attachment actions can only be used by paid G Suite accounts. These accounts must whitelist Workato's Gmail connector app and grant it read permission before it can successfully use these triggers and actions. The following section will guide you through the required steps.
