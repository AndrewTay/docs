# What are custom OAuth profiles?
In getting your Slack triggers up and running, you've created a Slack app (learn more in our [Slack trigger documentation](/connectors/slack/triggers.md#requirements). Suppose that in doing so, you've also spent considerable time customizing your app's name, icon, event subscriptions, and permission scopes, e.g. HelloBot that monitors when users are added to groups or public/private channels. You (or your team members) may want to use it in other recipes too &mdash; you can easily do so by using custom OAuth profiles in connections to those workspaces.

### Creating a custom OAuth profile
To get started, head to Tools âž¤ View all tools. Under **Connect apps**, click on **Custom OAuth profiles**. Once there, click on **Create a new custom OAuth profile**.

*If you don't see Custom OAuth profile, make sure your Workato team or account has access to it*

Next, choose **Slack** as your application.

In Step 2, click on **Create new app**.

This will open a new tab that brings you to https://api.slack.com/apps. Keep both the Workato tab and this new tab open - you'll need both to complete Steps 3 and 4.

Sign in to your team (if you haven't already), then click on **Create New App**.

In the form that pops up, give your app a name - it typically describes its intended functionality, e.g. HRBot or SupportBot.

Choose which Slack team this app belongs to, then click on **Create App**.

Your app should now be created! You should be greeted with your new bot's **Basic Information** page. If not - don't sweat it. Just click on **Basic Information** from the left navigation menu.

Scroll down to **App Credentials** you'll need this information back on your Workato tab. With this info handy, we can now head back to the Workato tab to complete Step 2.

In Step 3, fill up:
- **Name**: This should be the same name you used when creating the app e.g. HRBot
- **Client ID**
- **Client secret**
- **Verification token**

*Configuring Workato to talk to your app*

Hit **Save** once you're done. We can now configure your app to talk to Workato in Step 4.

### Enabling event subscriptions
To enable event subscriptions, go to your Slack app's page (it should look something like 'https://api.slack.com/apps/{your_app_id}' &mdash; your app ID is unique to your app). Under Event Subscriptions, turn on 'Enable Events', then paste the URL from your New event trigger into the Request URL field and click Save.

*Enabling event subscriptions*

For a [new event trigger](/connectors/slack/triggers.md#new-event-trigger-real-time) to pick up events, your app needs to know where to send these events to. That's why it comes with a target URL, generated once you've entered an **Event name**. Once your app is sending events to your recipe's target URL, the recipe can take over and execute your recipe's actions.

### Subscribing to workspace events
Slack provides an entire list of workspace events that you can subscribe to &mdash; any of these events can kick-start your recipes.

In this example, customer success users are given the option to create a private channel between themselves & their customers whenever messages containing the word 'resolve' are posted in certain channels and direct messages (DMs). Hence, the events `message.channels`, `message.groups` and `message.im` were chosen as triggers.

![Event subscription example](/assets/images/connectors/slack/event-subscription-example.png)
*Whenever a message is posted to a channel, a private channel, or a DM, an event is sent to the recipe*

Event subscriptions require permission scopes to be defined for your Slack app, but fret not &mdash; once event(s) are subscribed, Slack automatically adds the required scopes.

### Installing your app
Once you've subscribed to at least 1 workspace event, a permission scope is automatically added, allowing you to install the app to your workspace.

#### Installing your app to your Slack team
Now that you've finished configuring your app, you can now install it to your Slack team. From the left navigation menu, under **Settings**, head over to **Install App**.
- Click on **Install App to Workspace**

![Install app](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/install-app.png)

Choose your Slack team and authorize it to complete the installation.

Jumping back to your custom OAuth profile in Workato, under Step 4, click on **Done** to finish configuring the custom OAuth profile. You can now use this custom OAuth profile in other Slack connections in Workato!

### Using your custom OAuth profile
Once you've created a custom OAuth profile, anyone in your Workato workspace can use it in their own Slack connections to the Slack workspace &mdash; without having to create and configure a new Slack app.

*Using custom OAuth profiles in a new Slack connection*

Note that custom OAuth profiles, by definition, can only connect to a single Slack workspace. This means that the same custom OAuth profile cannot be used across multiple Slack workspaces.
