# Google Vision
[Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision) uses powerful machine learning to derive insight from your images. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (such as “sailboat”), detects individual objects and faces within images, and reads printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing scenarios through image sentiment analysis.

Workato's Google Vision connector allows you to build powerful automation and connect with other applications in the workflow.

## API version
The Google Vision connector uses [Google Cloud Vision API v1](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/).
