# Workato Dashboard

The Workato Dashboard allows users to visualize real-time data pertaining to the recipes and connections in their Workato account at a glance.

Recipe jobs can directly correlate to business metrics: For example, the number of new customers that are added to your CRM daily or the number of invoices that were processed that month. The Workato Dashboard allows users to see trends across time and find outliers that directly impact your businesses.

Additionally, it enables users to obtain a snapshot of the account's recipe issues and tackle them more efficiently. Alongside error notification emails, the dashboard goes a step further and helps target the issues that matter— Obtain a big picture view of recipe health, then drill down to the details of particular issues that stand out without going through individual recipes.
