# Workato Dashboard

The Workato Dashboard allows users to visualize real-time data pertaining to the recipes and connections in their Workato account at a glance.

Recipe jobs can directly correlate to business metrics: For example, the number of new customers that are added to your CRM daily or the number of invoices that were processed that month. The Workato Dashboard allows users to see trends across time and find outliers that directly impact your businesses.

Additionally, it enables users to obtain a snapshot of the account's recipe issues and tackle them more efficiently. Alongside error notification emails, the dashboard goes a step further and helps target the issues that matterâ€” Obtain a big picture view of recipe health, then drill down to the details of particular issues that stand out without going through individual recipes.

This guide will enable users to use the Workato Dashboard to the fullest and obtain the most accurate insights possible.

## Usage dashboard

The main preview consists of:
- A **Jobs graph** for a big picture view of recipe health
- A **Recipe details table** for a detailed breakdown by recipe
- An **App connection overview** for changes made to connection in the last 7 days

Aside from the main preview of your recipes and jobs (left), there is a small snippet (right) containing information about your active connections.

### Jobs graph
This gives users an overview of their recipes' health in a given timeframe. This snapshot is dynamic and will change according to the filter parameters that you define. Use the filter tools to modify the **Jobs graph** to show information about key folders/recipes.

For example, we can filter for **all active recipes** in the **Admin** folder that transpired in the **date range here**

#### Date, status, & folder filters
Workato Dashboard allows you to customize your filters by Date, Recipe status, and Folders. By default, the filters are set to `Last 7 days`, `All recipes` and `All folders`.

| Date filter | Recipe Status filter | Folder filter |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Select the timeframe that you want to observe.  | Filter your jobs by recipe status. | Get more insights by diving into folders and sub-folders.  |
| Use one of the dropdown selections or define a custom range. The default is set at `7 days`. | Select from `All recipes` (default), `Recipe with errors` and `Active recipes`. | Select the folder you want to examine or default to the `Home` folder. |

To define a custom date range, select **Pick a date range** from the date filter. Fill in the start date and end date in the `mm/dd/yy` format. You can use the calendar picker for convenience. There is no limit on the number of days that can be selected.

### Recipe details table
This section further dissects the jobs graph by individual recipes. It displays key information like **successful jobs**, **failed jobs**, and a description of the **latest job**.

Click on the relevant cells to find out more. For example, find out more about the **Failed jobs** by click on `13 Failed`. This will bring you to the corresponding [jobs tab](/recipes/jobs.md) on the recipe page.

If you have applied data and time filters, you will find that the jobs will be filtered automatically when you are redirected to this page

The filter feature allows you to rearrange the list by different priorities.
- Select `Failed job count` to identify the recipes that have the most number of failed jobs that require troubleshooting. This is the default selection.
- Select `Recipe status` to see inactive recipes before active ones.
- Select `Successful job count` to view the recipes with the highest number of jobs.
- Select `Recent job` to view the most recent job across all recipes.


### App connection overview
This section provides a quick way to monitor the changes to app connections in your Workato account. Note that the list of accounts connected and disconnected refers to changes made in the past 7 days. This is not affected by the date filters you apply on the main dashboard graph.
