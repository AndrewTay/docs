# Callable Recipes - Callable recipe as a REST endpoint

You can think of callable recipes as services that can be called to perform some tasks. It can be as simple as retrieve data or as nuanced as executing a complex workflow. These services are not restricted to calling for other APIs. Workato, through the API Platform, allows you to expose these callable recipes as REST endpoints. Callable recipes form the building blocsks of an API collection that can be used by business partners or internal stakeholders within your organization.

The [API Platform](/api-management.md) is a full-fledged API management platform that let's you build, maintain and consume APIs completely in the cloud.
