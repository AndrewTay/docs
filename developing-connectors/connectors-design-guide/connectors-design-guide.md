# Connectors design guide
This guide is meant for developers building SDK connectors on the Workato platform, and guides the design of connectors, triggers and actions. This guide is meant to maintain consistency in the style and behaviour of triggers and actions on the Workato platform, so as to provide a consistent experience for users building Workato recipes.

We recommend that you adopt these design patterns in SDK connectors that you're submitting for certification. This will help shorten the approval turnaround time and get your connector published on the Workato platform sooner.

In this guide we cover:
