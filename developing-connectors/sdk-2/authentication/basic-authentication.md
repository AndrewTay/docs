{# Basic Authentication

## Standard example

Typically, a basic authentication requires a username and password combination when making requests. Make sure to include those two fields in the connection fields definition.

In connection objects, you'll be able to define the input fields in the `fields` object array. Each object in the array represents a single input field. Inside, you'll be able to declare the name of the input field, hints that are displayed to the end user amongst other parameters. Below, we have a sample connection object inside the skeleton of a connector. This connection object is configured for basic authentication.

```ruby
{
  title: 'My cisco connector',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "username",
        hint: "Your email used for login"
      },
      {
        name: "password",
        hint: "Enter your password",
        optional: false,
        control_type: "password",
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["username"])
        password(connection["password"])
      end
    }
  },

  test: { ... },
  actions: { ... },
  triggers: { ... },
  object_definitions: { ... },
  picklists: { ... },
  methods: { ... },
}
```

To set up a basic authentication, simply define type: 'basic_auth' and include the appropriate values in `user()` and `password()` in the `apply` section. All requests made through the connector will contain the values defined in `apply`.

## Variations

Some APIs expect different conventions from a standard basic authentication. In the example below, Close.io API expects an API Key generated in the individual Userâ€™s account. It should be used as a username with a blank password in the standard basic authentication format.

So, to adjust the connections portion of the code to suit this behaviour, simply request for an API instead of username + password.

In the `apply` section, pass the api_key into `user()` and an empty string ("") to `password()`

```ruby
{
  title: 'My Close.io connector',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_key",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Profile (top right) > Settings > Your API Keys"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      # close.io uses api key only for authentication. treats apikey as username and password left blank
      # curl -u "{your api_key}:" "https://app.close.io/api/v1/me/"
      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["api_key"])
        password("")
      end
    }
  },

  test: { ... },
  actions: { ... },
  triggers: { ... },
  object_definitions: { ... },
  picklists: { ... },
  methods: { ... },
}
```
Another variation is to have a generated api_token replace the user name and have the string `"api_token"` replacing password in the basic authentication format. In the example below, we should be used as a username with a password as "api_token" in the standard basic authentication format to match what toggl expects.

```ruby
{
  title: 'My toggl connector',

  connection: {

    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_token",
        control_type: "password",
        label: "API token",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Available in 'My Profile' page"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      # Toggl API expect the token to be sent as user name and the string 'api_token' as the password
      # curl -u "{your api_token}:api_token" "https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/me"
      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["api_token"])
        password("api_token")
      end
    }
  },

  test: { ... },
  actions: { ... },
  triggers: { ... },
  object_definitions: { ... },
  picklists: { ... },
  methods: { ... },
}
```

## API Key Authentication

For APIs that expect API Key authentication, it is a slight variation from the basic authentication code above. Whilst API keys can be used in basic authentication and sent under usernames and passwords, some other API's expect them as URL parameters.

This is easily done with Workato's SDK by defining the type as "api_key" and using the `params` function to declare the user-given API key.

Make sure to include the required inputs from the user (subdomain, api_key, scope etc)

Define
1. type: `"api_key"`
2. the appropriate parameter name for the API Key. In this case, it is simply `"api_key"`

After defining this, calls will have the appropriate params appended.

Example:
`<BASE_URL>/users?api_key=NB674921`

```ruby
{
  title: 'My helpdesk connector',

  connection: {

    fields: [
      {
        name: "helpdesk",
        control_type: "subdomain",
        url: ".freshdesk.com",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Your helpdesk name as found in your Freshdesk URL"
      },
      {
        name: "api_key",
        control_type: "password",
        optional: false,
        label: "API key"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "api_key",

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        params(api_key: connection["api_key"])
      end
    }
  },

  test: { ... },
  actions: { ... },
  triggers: { ... },
  object_definitions: { ... },
  picklists: { ... },
  methods: { ... },
}
```
