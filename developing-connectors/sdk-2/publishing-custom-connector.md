# Getting your custom connector listed on Workato
Ready to build your custom connector and share it with all users on Workato? Here are the steps you'll need to take to list your connector on our [developer site](https://developer.workato.com/).

## Sign up for a developer account
If you don't already have a developer account, send us an email at accounts@workato.com with
1. Your company name
2. Your name
3. Your work email
4. A brief overview of your company and the custom connector you are hoping to build

We should respond within 1-2 working days with your account details.

## Building your connectors
Building a Workato connector means balancing the technical capabilities of the connector with overall user experience for those building recipes using your connector. We have ever growing list of documentation, guides and best practices which help you understand the Workato SDK and the coding guidelines we subscribe to.

We highly recommend reading the documentation that relate to the connector you want to build as well as going through the guides and best practices for additional context. When you submit your connector for final review by our team, these will be the standards that we would check against as well.

Besides the technical coding guidelines, Workato's SDK give you a wide range of options when you are looking configure the look and feel of your connector on the Workato platform. We suggest exploring all possible ways to make your connector as user friendly as possible. Some tips can also be found in the best practices section of our documentation.

There is no need to introduce a ton of triggers and actions in the first version of your connector. In fact, we'd prefer that you submitted a connector that satisfied a small number of critical integration use cases for users of your application. From our experience, we often encourage developers to work with product managers from their firm to build these connectors. By fleshing out simple essential use cases of how users in Workato could use recipes with your future connector, it not only helps narrow down what triggers and actions your initial connector should have but helps with the verification process on our end. This will also enable us to give you feedback on coding styles as well as usability. You can always add more actions later on.

## Testing your connectors
While you can test your connector directly from Workato's SDK code editor, we recommend building out the use cases as recipes in your account. This lets you test overall flow of the recipes your users would have and also reduces the number of bugs you'll see later on as more users on Workato start using your connector.

Use Workato's sharing ability to let others test your connector as well. You'll be able to share your custom connector via share links that let them install a copy of your connector in their accounts. That way, you'll get a sensing of any of the issues that may arise from your connector during the normal course of usage in Workato.

These share links may be sent to anyone including your coworkers or a set of beta users from your platform. You may also find it useful to share any recipes that you have with them. Be reminded that whoever you share a the custom connector with will need a Workato account of their own.

## Listing your connector on our developer site to be found by all users
After you have sufficiently tested your connector and gotten enough people to help you with testing, you can make your submission over here and we will begin our review process. This will include a developer from Workato to ensure your code meets our guidelines as well as a review on the usability aspect of your connector.
