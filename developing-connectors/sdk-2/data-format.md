# Data Formats

Workatos SDK supports the following data formats. Click on the following links to find out more about how to handle each of the following data formats. For the rest of our documentation however, we will assume that the API accepts and returns data in `JSON`.

- [JSON](data-format/json-format.md)
- [XML](data-format/xml-format.md)
- [Form URL Encoded](data-format/form-url-encoded.md)
- [Multipart Form](data-format/request_format_multipart_form.md)
