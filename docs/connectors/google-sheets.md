# Google Sheets
[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is a powerful cloud application that enables real-time team collaboration on spreadsheets, available on any device.

Workato enables you to write data to a Google spreadsheet automatically as part of a workflow, e.g. leads filling out a form will be moved to a spreadsheet. You can also read rows of data from Google spreadsheets and move it to another app, e.g. moving respondents who had filled out a Google Form from Google Sheets into a marketing campaign app, or into a CRM.

## API version
Workato's Google Sheets connector currently uses both Google Sheets [API v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/) and [API v3](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/v3/)
