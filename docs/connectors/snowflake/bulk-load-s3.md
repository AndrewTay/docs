# Snowflake - Bulk Load from external stage action

Load a file from an external stage Amazon S3 bucket as an external source into a target table. This action uses the [COPY](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html#output) command to load data directly from an external source to a target table.

This action will execute the load and wait for completion before moving onto the next step. Load time depends on the size of source file, number of columns, additional validation in the target table and network speed (faster if loading data from S3 to an AWS-deployed Snowflake instance). **1 GB** CSV file with **30 columns** and **3 million rows** will take 60 seconds.

The source file can contain data in CSV format, JSON, PARQUET and [other semi-structured file types](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html#format-type-options-formattypeoptions).
