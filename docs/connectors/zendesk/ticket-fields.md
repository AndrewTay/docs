# Zendesk - Ticket fields
Zendesk tickets contain various ticket fields that add information about the ticket. Some fields are required inputs by the requester (e.g. Subject), while some fields are outputs generated by the system (e.g. Ticket ID).

### Ticket default input fields
Zendesk's out-of-the-box ticket fields gather basic information. At default, only "subject" and "comment" is configured as mandatory.
