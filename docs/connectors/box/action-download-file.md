# Box Action - Download file
Download contents of a file. File contents can be used in subsequent steps of the recipe to upload the file into other applications.

In the example below, we use `File contents` data pill from Box's Download file action and provide that to Dropbox's Upload file action.

| Chunk size | File contents will be [streamed](/features/file-streaming.md) in chunks of this size. Enter the size with the unit, Eg. 50KB. Valid units are 'B', 'KB', 'MB'.
