# Box Trigger - New CSV file in directory
Triggers when a new CSV file is added to a specified folder and processes CSV lines in batches. Trigger will not pick up newly uploaded versions of the same file. Checks selected folder for CSV files every 5 minutes. CSV rows are delivered in batches of 100 by default, maximum is 50000.

## Input fields

| Column delimiter | The character used to separate column values within each CSV row. |
| Contains header row? | Set to Yes if the first CSV row is a header row, containing column names. Workato will then not process the first row as CSV data. |
