# Workday
[Workday](https://www.workday.com/) is a cloud financial management and human capital management software that seamlessly combines finance and HR for greater business performance and visibility into organizational data.

Workday has multiple web services that can be used to integrate data. Workday SOAP API provides a set of operations to read and write data in and out of Workday while the Workday Report-as-a-Service allows reading data from all custom reports (must be web service enabled first). Workato uses these services to create powerful integration scenarios.

Use the Workday integration connector to sync data between your Workday instance and other cloud applications.

The Workday connector documentation contains the following chapters:
- [Connection setup](workday/connection_setup.md)
- [Scheduled report trigger](workday/scheduled_report.md)
- [Get report action](workday/get_report.md)
- [Call operation action](workday/call_operation.md)
- [Workday RaaS](workday/workday_raas.md)
