# NetSuite Action - Create records in bulk

The actions `Create standard records in bulk` and `Create custom records in bulk` allow you to create in bulk standard records or custom records.

They accept a list of a maximum 400 records. Actions will fail if more than 400 records are provided.

## Input fields
Select the `Standard record` or `Custom record` you want to create. In this example, we select `Customer`:

After that, you can proceed to configure the next sections.

### Field configuration
This section allows you to shortlist which NetSuite fields you want to use. Only those shortlisted fields will be displayed in action's input and output. This makes it easier to work with complex NetSuite objects with hundreds of fields.

In this example, we just want to use the fields `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, `phone` from the `Customer` record:

The followings are all input fields in this section:

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| Fields | The Netsuite record's main fields to be shortlisted. |
| Custom fields | The Netsuite record's custom fields to be shortlisted. |
| Custom segment schema | If your Netsuite record has custom schema, you can define the custom schema here. |
| Line item custom fields | The Netsuite record's line item custom fields to be shortlisted. |
| Line item custom segment schema | If your Netsuite line item has custom schema, you can define the custom schema here. |

### Record
This section's name will change based on your selected `Standard record` or `Custom record`. In this section, you will provide data mappings to create the NetSuite records.

In this example, we map the data from the Box trigger `New CSV file in directory` into NetSuite record `Customer`. Notice that only the shortlisted fields `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, `phone` are displayed here.

The followings are all input fields in this section:

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| Record source list | You need to provide a [list data pill](/features/list-management.md) here. For example, list of rows in a CSV file. The action will automatically iterate through all items in the list and map them to NetSuite records. |
| Record fields | Here you need to map the data pills under the list data pill provided above. For example, CSV column names under the `CSV Rows` list data pill. The action will automatically iterate through all items in the list and map them to NetSuite records. |

## Output fields

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| Number of processed records | Total number of records processed. |
| Number of successful records | Number of records successfully created. |
| Number of failed records | Number of records failed to be created. |
