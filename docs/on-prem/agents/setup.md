# Setting up On-prem Agent

Before getting started on **on-prem agents**, you should have set up an **on-prem group**:
1. [Create](/on-prem/groups/create-group.md) an on-prem group.
2. [Add agent](/on-prem/groups/add-agent) to your on-prem group.

After setting up the on-prem agent on your network and testing the connection, your on-prem agent has been successfully been set up.

Now you can:

2. [Configure connection profiles](/on-prem/agents/profile.md) for your agents.
3. Set up recipe connections [with on-prem agents](/on-prem/agents/connection.md).
4. [Upgrade](/on-prem/agents/upgrade.md) your on-prem agent.
5. Set up [password encryption](/on-prem/agents/password-encryption.md).
6. Set up a [proxy environment](/on-prem/agents/proxy.md) for your on-prem agent.
7. Connect to legacy applications [using Java](/on-prem/agents/extension.md).
