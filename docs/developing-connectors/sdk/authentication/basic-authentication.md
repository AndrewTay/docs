# Basic Authentication
Typically, a basic authentication requires a username and password combination when making requests. Make sure to include those two fields in the connection fields definition.

In the `connection:` block, you'll be able to define the input fields in the `fields:` block in an array of hashes. Each hash in the array represents a single input field. Inside, you'll be able to declare the name of the input field, hints that are displayed to the end user amongst other parameters. Below, we have a sample custom connector skeleton with a `connection:` block filled in. This `connection:` block is configured for basic authentication.

## Simple Basic Auth
```ruby
{
  title: 'My cisco connector',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "username",
        hint: "Your email used for login"
      },
      {
        name: "password",
        hint: "Enter your password",
        optional: false,
        control_type: "password",
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["username"])
        password(connection["password"])
      end
    }
  },

  test: {
    # Some code here
  },
  actions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  triggers: {
    # Some code here
  },
  object_definitions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  picklists: {
    # Some code here
  },
  methods: {
    # Some code here
  },
}
```

To set up a basic authentication, simply define `type:` as `basic_auth` and include the appropriate values in `user()` and `password()` in the `apply` section. All future HTTP requests made through the connector will contain the values defined in the `apply:` block.

> Our user() and password() helper functions are already base64 encoded behind the scenes so you needn't have to worry about that!

This means that in the snippet above, every HTTP request made in the connector would have the `user` and `password` attached in the header to help authenticate that specific request.

## Variations of basic authentication
Some APIs expect different conventions from a standard basic authentication. In the example below, Close.io API expects an API key generated in the individual Userâ€™s account. It should be used as a username with a blank password in the standard basic authentication format.

So, to adjust the connections portion of the code to suit this behaviour, simply request for an API instead of username + password.

In the `apply` section, pass the api_key into `user()` and an empty string ("") to `password()`

### Sample code snippet
```ruby
{
  title: 'My Close.io connector',

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_key",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Profile (top right) > Settings > Your API Keys"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      # close.io uses api key only for authentication. treats apikey as username and password left blank
      # curl -u "{your api_key}:" "https://app.close.io/api/v1/me/"
      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["api_key"])
        password("")
      end
    }
  },

  test: {
    # Some code here
  },
  actions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  triggers: {
    # Some code here
  },
  object_definitions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  picklists: {
    # Some code here
  },
  methods: {
    # Some code here
  },
}
```
Another variation is to have a generated api_token replace the user name and have the string `"api_token"` replacing password in the basic authentication format. In the example below, we should be used as a username with a password as "api_token" in the standard basic authentication format to match what toggl expects.

```ruby
{
  title: 'My toggl connector',

  connection: {

    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_token",
        control_type: "password",
        label: "API token",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Available in 'My Profile' page"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "basic_auth",

      # Toggl API expect the token to be sent as user name and the string 'api_token' as the password
      # curl -u "{your api_token}:api_token" "https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/me"
      apply: lambda do |connection|
        user(connection["api_token"])
        password("api_token")
      end
    }
  },

  test: {
    # Some code here
  },
  actions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  triggers: {
    # Some code here
  },
  object_definitions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  picklists: {
    # Some code here
  },
  methods: {
    # Some code here
  },
}
```

## API Key Authentication
For APIs that expect API Key authentication, it is a slight variation from the basic authentication code above. Whilst API keys can be used in basic authentication and sent under usernames and passwords, some other API's expect them as URL parameters.

This is easily done with Workato's SDK by defining the type as "api_key" and using the `params` function to declare the user-given API key.

Make sure to include the required inputs from the user (subdomain, api_key, scope etc)

Define
1. type: `"api_key"`
2. the appropriate parameter name for the API Key. In this case, it is simply `"api_key"`

After defining this, calls will have the appropriate params appended.

Example:
`<BASE_URL>/users?api_key=NB674921`

```ruby
{
  title: 'My helpdesk connector',

  connection: {

    fields: [
      {
        name: "helpdesk",
        control_type: "subdomain",
        url: ".freshdesk.com",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Your helpdesk name as found in your Freshdesk URL"
      },
      {
        name: "api_key",
        control_type: "password",
        optional: false,
        label: "API key"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "api_key",

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        params(api_key: connection["api_key"])
      end
    }
  },

  test: {
    # Some code here
  },
  actions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  triggers: {
    # Some code here
  },
  object_definitions: {
    # Some code here
  },
  picklists: {
    # Some code here
  },
  methods: {
    # Some code here
  },
}
```
