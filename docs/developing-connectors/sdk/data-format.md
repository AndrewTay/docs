# Data Formats
When looking to connect to an API, one of the first questions to ask is what data format the API supports. The Workato SDK supports the following data formats which should cover all but a small minority of APIs out there.

Click on the following links to find out more about how to handle each of the following data formats. For the rest of our documentation however, we will assume that the API supports data in `JSON`.

- [JSON](data-format/json-format.md)
- [XML](data-format/xml-format.md)
- [URL Encoded Form](data-format/form-url-encoded.md)
- [Multipart Form](data-format/request_format_multipart_form.md)

If you're already familiar with the data formats we support, check out the authentication types that our SDK supports as well as how to implement them.
