# Formulas
Users can use formulas to transform data using Workato. Formulas allow users to easily work with and format data. Formulas in Workato are whitelisted Ruby methods. Not all Ruby methods are supported, but you can always [reach out to us](contact-us.md) to add additional formulas to the whitelist. Syntax and functionality for these formulas are generally unchanged.

Workato allows you to work with the following standard data types:
- [String](/formulas/string-formulas.md)
- [Integer or number](/formulas/number-formulas.md)
- [Date or datetime](/formulas/date-formulas.md)
- [Array/hash (list)](/formulas/array-list-formulas.md)
- To work with complex data types, see [here](/formulas/complex-data-types.md)
- <!-- suggestion, link complex data types to files & attachment / parsers -->
