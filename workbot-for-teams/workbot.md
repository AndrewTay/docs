# Workbot for Teams
Workbot for Teams is a Workato chatbot that helps you monitor and interact with your business apps from within Teams.

Your team can configure Workbot to post messages to Teams users and channels when important events happen, such as when a key customer files a ticket, a lead from a Fortune 500 company fills in a form on your website, or when a DevOps alert is created.

You can also retrieve information from your apps and post it to Teams, creating and updating business data from within it.
