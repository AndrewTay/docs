# Using Workbot for MS Teams
## Workbot commands
You can perform actions in your apps (e.g. creating new ServiceNow tickets, listing Salesforce opportunities) by sending Workbot commands from within Teams.

![Command example](/assets/images/workbot-for-teams/workbot-command-example.png)
*Sending a 'newissue' command with additional parameters in Teams, then receiving a post message reply*

A Workbot command is a trigger that allows you to run a Workbot command recipe.

*Example 'newissue' command in a recipe*

>To learn more about Workbot commands, see [Workbot commands](/workbot-for-teams/workbot-triggers.md).

### Workbot 'help'
If you get stuck, you can always send the **help** command to Workbot. Workbot will respond with the list of commands available to you.

### Invoking Workbot commands in Teams
Workbot commands can be invoked in 3 distinct ways:
1. Sending the command in a direct message to Workbot or in a channel (in a channel, this requires tagging Workbot i.e. **@workbot your_command**)<br>

<br>
2. Sending the command when a button is clicked<br>

3. Submitting a task module form.

Commands can also prompt users for additional parameters. For example, to create a new ServiceNow incident, the user should provide the urgency, summary and description of the incident. In this case, you can add 3 parameters; `urgency`, `summary` & `description`. When the command is invoked, Workbot will open a task module and prompt the user for each parameter.

*Workbot can ask users for info if you specify additional parameters in your command*

## Event notifications using Post message action
Workbot can also be used to notify you when any events occur in your apps. This can be done via the **Post message** action.

*A Post message action notifying user about a closed ticket in ServiceNow*

The **Post message** action allows you to post a message to a user or in a channel.
